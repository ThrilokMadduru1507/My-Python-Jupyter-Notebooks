Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall measures the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples. The F1 score combines these two metrics into a single value, providing a balance between precision and recall. F1 score ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect precision and recall, and 0 indicates the worst performance. It's a useful metric when you want to consider both false positives and false negatives, making it suitable for scenarios where you want a balance between precision and recall."

    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  \n",
    "    - As compared to other models, this model is having F1 Score of 71% compared to other models.\n",

    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",

    "\n",
    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? Consider any insights that you could report back to stakeholders."
